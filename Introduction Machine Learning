Machine Learning
It is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that assists systems to learn and improve automatically from experience without being explicitly programmed.
- Arthur Samuel coined the term machine learning (ML) in 1959.
- It enables programs to learn automatically, making computers more intelligent without human intervention.

Machine learning approach:

- Learns from data to make predictions or take actions without being explicitly programmed.
- Uses statistical techniques and optimization algorithms to learn patterns and make decisions
- Automatically learns features from raw data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering
- Handles complex and unstructured data, such as images, text, and audio, without requiring extensive preprocessing
- Performance improves with more data and learning iterations, enhancing accuracy and generalization

Difference Between ML, DL, and AI

Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and artificial intelligence (AI) are often used interchangeably.
AI: It encompasses the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
• Example: Self-driving cars
ML: It is a subset of AI, which focuses on algorithms that enable computers to learn from data.
• Example: Amazon Alexa
DL: It is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers for complex pattern recognition, such as recognizing patterns in images, speech, and text.
• Example: Handwriting recognition


Machine Learning Example:

In a chess game between a computer and a person, the computer uses AI to analyze the game, predict moves, and decide its actions.
The AI decides its next move against the opponent using a complex neural network that learns various features and patterns from the data.
The AI uses machine learning to figure out if the opponent is a beginner, intermediate, or advanced player.

Machine Learning Algorithms: 
These processes allow computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions on their own.
Machine learning algorithms help applications to:
- Predict outcomes
- Improve the performance
- Classify the target feature

Types of Machine Learning:

ML can be divided into four main categories; each characterized by its capacity to predict conditions or identify patterns to produce outcomes.

Type 1: Supervised Learning:

A supervised learning method uses labeled data to predict outcomes guided by specificinput-output pairs.
Supervised Learning Algorithms: 
Some commonly known supervised learning algorithms are:
- Decision trees
- Support vector machines
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression

Some examples of supervised learning are:
- Predicting temperature rise based on yearly temperature trends
- Sorting waste based on known waste items and their corresponding waste types 
- Predicting crop yield based on seasonal crop quality changes

Type 2: Unsupervised Learning:

It allows models to identify patterns and structures in unlabeled data without explicit guidance.
Some examples are:
The unlabeled dataset is provided to an unsupervised learning algorithm to discover hidden patterns and recognize their relationship.
- Image segmentation for object detection
- Identification of user groups based on commonalities
- Identification of anomalies over geographical landscapes based on the data patterns

Unsupervised Learning Example:
It automatically groups images into distinct categories based on similarities, such as age group or gender, without any prior labels.

Type 3: Semi-Supervised Learning:

It uses a combination of a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data for training.
- Like supervised learning, it aims to learn a function that can accurately predict the output variable from the input variables.
- It uses unlabeled input to assist the learning process by collecting more information or improving model generalization.
Hence, it falls between supervised and unsupervised learning.

Semi-Supervised Learning: Example: 
This dataset contains both labeled and unlabeled data. Hence, semi-supervised learning is applied.

Google Photos is a popular example of semi-supervised learning.
In various instances, uploaders label images. Despite Google's lack of knowledge regarding image names, its algorithm can identify them by analyzing visual features like shapes and colors.
Whenever a picture is taken, it gets stored in the Google Cloud platform or a database.

Type 4: Reinforcement Learning:
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where algorithms learn from the environment by performing actions and receiving either rewards or penalties as feedback.
- If the program finds the correct solution, the interpreter rewards the algorithm.
- If the outcome is incorrect, the algorithm is penalized for incorrect predictions. It must reiterate until it finds a better result.

It involves an agent interacting with an environment, learning from rewards and states, to choose the best actions and improve performance over time.

Reinforcement Learning: Example:

This type of learning is best seen in YouTube recommendations, where a user searches for a particular song, and the program shows the list of available songs.
When the user selects a specific song, the system trains itself to remember and deliver a similar result for future searches based on user interactions, such as likes, views and shares.

Python Libraries Used in Machine Learning: 
Some Python libraries used in machine learning include:
- NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python.
- Matplotlib performs data visualization and graphical plotting.
- Pandas is a versatile data manipulation library in Python, offering data structures like DataFrames.
- SciPy solves mathematical equations and processes algorithms.
- Scikit-learn offers efficient versions of common algorithms, facilitating the development of machine learning models.
